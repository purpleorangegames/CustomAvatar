# CustomAvatar

To add custom portraits to the Avatar mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3111373293

Right click the avatar portrait and choose 'Save as Static Image'
This will create an image at %appdata%\..\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\avatar
The filename contains the full pawn name without ' and space changed to _

When this image exists it will use the image instead of the generated avatar
This means that you can edit the image and it will reflect on the game

If you want to revert back to the generated avatar, right click and choose 'Remove Static Image'
Click into another pawn and back and you will see it went back to normal
